Recent Computer Games Technology graduate from Anglia Ruskin University with a unique blend of technical expertise and community leadership experience. With 18+ years of GNU/Linux expertise and a passion for emerging technologies, I bring both deep technical knowledge and proven ability to build and lead technical communities. Co-founder of a regional Linux User Group in Italy, combining strong programming skills in C#, C++, Unity, and Unreal Engine with real-world project management experience.

## My technical Journey
My relationship with technology began in 2007 when I embraced GNU/Linux, leading to nearly two decades of continuous learning and community involvement. This passion culminated in earning my BSc in Computer Games Technology, where I specialized in game engine development, graphics programming, and audio implementation.

### Recent Academic Highlights:
* **Collaborative Game Development**: Contributed to the technical team on a 24-person project using Unreal Engine 5, developing character controller mechanics and implementing comprehensive in-game audio using UE5's built-in audio system, successfully publishing an alpha game on [Itch.io](https://clever-critter-games.itch.io/crystal-chaos)
* **Advanced Shader Development**: Created custom toon shaders with realtime outline, and custom bloom post-processing effects using Unity's Scriptable Render Pipeline
* **Technical Leadership**: Implemented version control workflows and collaborated in agile development environments

## Technical Expertise

### Core Programming Languages:
* C# & C++ - Advanced game development and systems programming
* Java & Kotlin - Android development with modern practices
* Ruby, SQL, C - Supporting languages for diverse technical challenges

### Game Development Stack:
* Unity & Unreal Engine 5 - Complete game development pipeline
* FMOD - Professional audio implementation
* Custom shader development and graphics optimization

### Professional Development Tools:
* GitHub, Android Studio, Visual Studio
* TDD/BDD methodologies, Agile development
* PostgreSQL, Firebase, ML Kit integration

## Real-World Experience
My technical skills have been proven through practical application:

* **Android Development**: Delivered multiple applications using Kotlin, implementing ML Kit features and Firebase authentication with test-driven development practices
* **Community Leadership**: Co-founded and maintained a thriving regional Linux User Group, demonstrating ability to build sustainable technical communities
* **Project Management**: Successfully managed teams of 5-15 people across various roles, developing strong leadership and problem-solving skills

## Beyond the Code
When I'm not programming, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or composing music on guitar - a creative pursuit I've enjoyed since 2003. I'm also passionate about natural bodybuilding and continuous learning through technical literature, believing that diverse interests contribute to creative problem-solving in software development.

## What Drives Me
I believe that indie games are the future of the industry and the monopoly of big companies is finished. This is an exciting time where everybody has the opportunity to make games and be successful. My experience building communities, combined with deep technical expertise and multilingual communication skills (Italian native, English fluent, conversational Spanish), positions me perfectly to contribute to this independent game development revolution and create meaningful gaming experiences.

## My Approach
With 18+ years of Linux expertise, formal education in game technology, and proven leadership experience, I approach every project with:

* **Technical Excellence**: Deep understanding of software architecture and best practices
* **Community Focus**: Experience building and maintaining technical communities
* **Continuous Growth**: Self-directed learning mindset that keeps me current with emerging technologies
* **Cross-Cultural Communication**: International perspective from working across different cultures and languages
