# Project Overview
![image-center](/assets/images/projects/cosmic-control-enterprises/cce-thumb.png){: .align-center}
*Cosmic Control Enterprises* is a puzzle game set up on *The Expanse* (**James S. A. Corey, 2011**), one of the most well-known science fiction book series adapted into a successful TV show. I attempted to give the player the impression that they were in control of a crucial mission, starting the game inside the room I constructed using the assets pack provided by the university: save the Rocinante‚Äôs crew first and preserve humanity's one remaining chance to explore alien worlds and settle habitable planets in the Milky Way and beyond. 
It is obvious that the game *Please, don't touch anything!* (**Four Quarters team, 2015**) was the inspiration for this one.

# Key Features
## üåå Sci-fi background
For this project I decided to use the [Synty Polygon - Sci-Fi Space Pack](https://syntystore.com/en-gb/products/polygon-sci-fi-space-pack?_pos=2&_sid=12c8ce5a0&_ss=r) perfect for the set up of this game (see **Figure 1**).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interacting with The Puzzles
The puzzle in game are available step by step after completing a series of action by the player. The player can just move the camera and interact with the main console (see **Figure 2**).

## ‚ö° Hint
A hint to opening the safe has been hidden in one of the computer screens (see **Figure 3 and 4**). I decided to use the number 6765 from the Fibonacci sequence to help the player address an easy mathematics problem.

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Win & Lose Conditions
### üöÄ Win Condition
To access the ‚ÄúWin screen‚Äù (see **Figure 5**), players must complete a series of puzzles in the game within 5 minutes countdown(see **Figure 6**). In the first, the player must learn how to press specific buttons to activate the various consoles.
